# Pedestrian-Detection-System
The method will attempt to a build machine learning model that can perform pedestrian detection. This method will attempt to do this using two different kinds of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture model which are SSD MobileNet and SSD ResNet50 models, through the use of transfer learning.
